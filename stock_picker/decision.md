**Companies Not Selected**:

1. **Zebra Technologies**  
   - **Reason for Not Selection**: While Zebra Technologies holds a strong market position in barcode scanning and supply chain solutions, it is currently facing declining profit margins due to increased operating costs. The decrease in fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA and high operational costs contribute to its current financial challenges despite its established market presence.

     - **2023 Revenue**: $5.19 billion  
     - **Adjusted EBITDA**: $155 million  
     - **Gross Profit Margin**: 22.5%  
     - **Outlook**: Focus on technological advancements in supply chain solutions.

2. **NerdWallet**  
   - **Reason for Not Selection**: NerdWallet has shown good performance with strong revenue growth driven by user engagement with enhanced AI-driven tools. However, the year-over-year growth rate of 31%, while solid, does not compare to the higher growth rates realized by Procept BioRobotics. It remains a potential opportunity in the personal finance platform sector, but does not surpass the growth prospects of Procept.
   - **Key Metrics**:  
     - **2023 Revenue**: $599.4 million  
     - **GAAP Income from Operations**: $3.6 million
